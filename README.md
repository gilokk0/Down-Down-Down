# Down, Down, Down
Ludum Dare 48 Game Jam! Theme: Deeper and deeper.

Based on the book ["Alice's Adventures Under Ground" by Lewis Carroll](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19002/19002-h/19002-h.htm), "Down, Down, Down" is a Narrative/2D Top Down/Platform game, by which I mean it has a little bit of everything, in which you play as a young girl who fell down a rabbit hole while chasing a white rabbit.
